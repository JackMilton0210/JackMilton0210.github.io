                            job and decides to take out his rage on the co-workers around him all while keeping the place spotless.</p>
                            <p>Beat 'Em Mop was developed as part of a 7-person group project over the course of 4 months. I was the
                            game's programmer and was responsible for coding, implementing assets and managing source control.</p></div>

                                <p>The biggest challenge through the project was the combat system.</p>
                                <p>
                                The earliest implementation saw the player simply damage enemies if they were standing in front of him.
                                This was sufficient for the beginning stages of development.</p>
                                <p>Once the first pass animations were implemented, a key frame system was developed such that the attack hitbox could be repositioned and resized for each frame.
                                The hitboxes were then mapped to match the weapon perfectly.</p>
                                <p>However after the final versions of the animations were developed, it became apperent that this could be improved.
                                The keyframes were extended farther to provide a more fun and fluid feeling.
