<p>Beat Em Mop is a 2D arcade style fighting game where you play as the janitor who has had enough of his job and decides to take out his rage on the co-workers around him all while keeping the place spotless.
Beat 'Em Mop was developed as part of a 7-person group project over the course of 4 months. I was the game's programmer and was responsible for coding, implementing assets and managing source control.</p>
